# HandwrittenCharacterRecognitionSystem-Hindi
In the area of computer vision and natural language processing, handwriting recognition is an
important problem. We&#39;re going to build a handwritten text recognition system for Hindi using
Python programming language in this project. If we consider the areas of image care and model
recognition, handwritten text affirmation is now one of the most gripping and fascinating fields of
study It allows us to create a better interactive system between humans and computers, which is
largely due to the development of motor interaction. Handwriting recognition is the process of
converting a language which has already been included in its unique geographic form of graphics
engraved to an accurate representation. We must apply image processing and machine learning
techniques to extract information from handwritten text samples for the purpose of developing a
handwriting recognition system, as well as training models that can recognize these features. The
reliability of the system rests on the quality and quantity of training data, its efficiency when it
comes to capturing relevant features using Machine Learning algorithms that have been applied.
